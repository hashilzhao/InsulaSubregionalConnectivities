# Insular subregional functional connectivity analysis 
The processing pipeline of functional connectivity were based on the below codes step by step:

Step 0: nonâ€“brain tissue elimination using bet2

s0_non-brain_tissue_elimination.sh

Step 1: MPRAGE Images segmenation & preprocessing including removing head motion artifact using MCFLIRT, filtering using a non-linear high pass filter (100s), spatially smoothing using a 5-mm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, and grand-mean intensity normalization

Step 2: SEEDS transformation of seeds from standard space into individuals' space & Signals extraction of the eight confounders including six motion parameters, white matter signal, cerebrospinal fluid signal, and their associated derivatives.

Step 3: normalizing the singals of extracted eight confounders in step 2 above.

Step 4: regressing eight confounders.

Step 5: SEEDS signals extraction & Residuals Normalization

s5_residuals_normalization.sh

Step 6: Normalization of extracted SEEDS signals sequences.
